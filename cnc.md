We have a custom made CNC mill /  plasma cutter, model number DG-1335, made by manufacturers in Shenzhen. They have done a great job in making this machine for us.

The maximum dimensions of the machine are 2400mm x 1200mm. The controller is a [WeiHong NK105 G3](https://m.weihong.com.cn/en/product/nk105). We have found that model preparation is best done in Autodesk Fusion 360 which can be downloaded [HERE](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual).

You can find resources for the machine [HERE](https://wzku-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/spencers_wku_edu_cn/EoJ2IyhylPhMid5fTw8rP70BqSALk0J_PSR9lEeSHX1UqA?e=q7EtRQ), and the machine zero (MCS) is at:

X: -492.918 <br>
Y: -570.864 <br>
Z: -7.203 <br>

(the z value is for the current bit setup and will change when you change the bit).

You can prepare your mesh file using the following tutorial:
