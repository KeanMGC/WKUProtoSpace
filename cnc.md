We have a custom made CNC mill /  plasma cutter, model number DG-1335, made by manufacturers in Shenzhen. They have done a great job in making this machine for us.

The controller is a [WeiHong NK105 G3](https://m.weihong.com.cn/en/product/nk105). You can view the controller manual online [here](https://wenku.baidu.com/view/9e5386d077eeaeaad1f34693daef5ef7ba0d12e0.html?rec_flag=default&fr=Recommend_RelativeDoc-60389,114,60272,60320,60351,40355-kpdrec_doc_pc_view-38c645c59ec3d5bbfd0a74c2&sxts=1634796975841)

We have found that model preparation is best done in Autodesk Fusion 360 which can be downloaded [here](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual).

The maximum dimensions of the machine are 2400mm x 1200mm.
