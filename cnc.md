We have a custom made CNC mill /  plasma cutter, model number DG-1335, made by manufacturers in Shenzhen. They have done a great job in making this machine for us.

The maximum dimensions of the machine are 2400mm x 1200mm. The controller is a [WeiHong NK105 G3](https://m.weihong.com.cn/en/product/nk105). We have found that model preparation is best done in Autodesk Fusion 360 which can be downloaded [HERE](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual).
