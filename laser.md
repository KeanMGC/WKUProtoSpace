### Policies:

Faculty, Staff, and Students become eligible to qualify for use of the  laser cutters by enrolling in or completing a training course.

###### -Have a buddy at all times, who is physically present in the room, remains attentive, and is capable of assisting in an emergency.
If you do not have a buddy, even for a brief moment, laser cutter operation must immediately be stopped by pressing the “pause” button, do not resume until you have a buddy again.

###### -Prior to operating a laser cutter, clean the laser and make sure it is set to the proper height and scan the QR code.

###### -Follow all safety procedures posted around the WKU MGC prototyping space.

###### -Know the location of all fire extinguishers, emergency stop buttons, emergency phone, and emergency exits.

###### -Be sure that you are cutting an approved material. (See material selection below)

###### -Clean up after yourself:

-Clean off the laser cutter bed, but don’t try to lift the grid. If you need to get under the grid, get one of the staff to help you.

-Throw out small pieces of scrap in the appropriate bin.

Put scrap pieces that have uncut areas that are at least 3″ x 3″ into the appropriate (same color, same material) storage slot.

###### Failure to adhere to the above regulations or to cooperate with staff will result in revocation of laser cutter privileges.

#### Selecting and Procuring Material for the Laser Cutter


Some material cannot be used on the laser cutter because:

-the laser isn’t powerful enough to cut through it

-it is flammable

-or it produces dangerous off-gasses.

###### Approved materials:
acrylic, mirrored acrylic, cardboard, mat board, hardboard, chipboard, museum board, polystyrene, YUPO synthetic paper, MDF (engineered wood), bass wood, plywood, Delrin

###### Textiles:
Good: Felt, rayon, tightly woven cotton, wool, most natural materials; OK: loose weaves, knotted material

###### Forbidden materials:
ABS plastic, mirrored glass (the backing contains mercury), Lexan plastics, polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), foam (of any type), any materials containing chloride or vinyl (e.g. PVC), and wood thicker than 1/4″ (6mm).  Forbidden textiles: flammable synthetics, vinyl, metallic/reflective materials, neoprene, any material with chlorine. Ask IDeATe staff if you are unsure.

###### Danger! Chlorine:
Do not cut any materials that contain chlorine; they can produce chlorine gas when heated. If you are unsure of the chemical composition of your material, you can check the Material Safety  Data Sheets on the EH&S website. If you have a questions about a material that you would like to cut, please ask a staff member!

###### Metals:
Our laser cutters are incapable of cutting steel, brass, copper, and other metals.
